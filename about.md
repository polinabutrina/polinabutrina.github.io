<p>Hi! I'm Polina, a Transporation Plangineer and a Data Analyst living in Seattle.</p>

<p>I have 5+ years of experience in transportation engineering/planning, data analytics, and visualization. I currently work as a Data Analyst within the Data Science team at Puget Sound Regional Council analyzing travel data to build a deeper understanding of how people in our region travel.</p>

<p>Previously, I was a transportation planner at <a href="https://www.transpogroup.com/">Transpo Group</a> where I was crunching numbers, optimizing data processing tasks, analyzing data, and making a lot of maps that can help cities and counties understand transportation and mobility issues.</p>

<p>Also, I was a part of <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/sctlctr/urban-freight-lab-0">Urban Freight Lab at UW</a> where I researched freight mobility and last-mile delivery, including the final 50 feet of the delivery, package lockers, and freight bicycles.</p>

<p>I am passionate about emerging personal and freight mobility in the cities and how it's changing the way people and packages move around the city.</p>
